# Components

To help provide a better user experience, there are Prompt and Loader helper components provided.

These components are entirely optional, but will help to direct users to the Headless tab if necessary and provide feedback about the state of active API requests.

Example:

```js
import React, { ReactElement } from 'react'
import { Args } from '@storybook/addons'
import {
    FetchStatus,
    HeadlessSotryContext,
    Loader,
    Prompt,
} from 'storybook-addon-headless'

import { Component } from './Component'

export const story = (
    args: Args,
    { status, data }: HeadlessStoryContext,
): ReactElement | null => {
    switch (status?.Foo) {
        case FetchStatus.Inactive:
        case FetchStatus.Rejected:
            return <Prompt />

        case FetchStatus.Loading:
            return <Loader />

        default:
            return data?.Foo ? <Component {...data.Foo} /> : null
    }
}
```

Feel free to pass in custom a `headline` and/or `message` to the `Prompt` to make it more specific to your story or to the status of the API call.

**Experimental** _(read: untested)_:

There are also two methods for those of you not using React, but wanting to use these helper components. `useHeadlessPrompt` and `useHeadlessLoader` will render the React components as standalone apps, but you must provide an HTML element reference that has been rendered and mounted by your framework of choice.

Theoretically:

```js
import { useHeadlessLoader } from 'storybook-addon-headless'

export const story = () => {
    let ref

    onMount(() => {
        useHeadlessLoader(ref)
    })

    return <div bind:this={ref} />
}
```

This will vary depending on how Storybook supports your framework, how stories are written, as well as on how your framework handles DOM element references.

My apologies if this doesn't work our for your particular use case.
