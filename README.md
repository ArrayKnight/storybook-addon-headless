# Storybook Addon Headless

Storybook Addon Headless allows you to preview data from a headless CMS inside stories in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). It supports Restful and GraphQL APIs with the help of [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) and [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) respectively. And each query can handle variables which are validated using [Ajv](https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv).

### Upgrading to v2

_Dependencies **Storybook@6** and **Apollo@3** have been released!_

Be aware of the change to Storybook's story parameters, StoryContext (where `data` is accessed) is now the second parameter.

## Getting Started

#### Install

First of all, you need to install Headless into your project as a dev dependency.

```sh
npm install --save-dev storybook-addon-headless
```

#### Register

Then, configure it as an addon by adding it to your `addons.js` file (located in the Storybook config directory).

```js
import 'storybook-addon-headless/register'
```

Or to the `addons` parameter in your `main.js` file (located in the Storybook config directory).

```js
module.exports = {
    addons: ['storybook-addon-headless/register'],
    ...,
}
```

#### Decorate

Depending on the need of your project, you can either, add the `withHeadless` decorator:

-   Globally in `config.js` via `addDecorator(withHeadless({ ... }))`
-   Locally via `storiesOf('Name', module).addDecorator(withHeadless({ ... }))`
-   Locally to a story via CSF:

```js
export default {
    ...,
    decorators: [withHeadless({ ... })],
    ...,
}
```

You can find options documented as [HeadlessOptions](https://github.com/ArrayKnight/storybook-addon-headless/blob/master/src/types/options.ts) and on the [documentation site](https://storybook-addon-headless.netlify.com/?path=/story/options--page).

##### [Options](https://storybook-addon-headless.netlify.com/?path=/story/options--page)

```js
{
    graphql?: GraphQLOptionsTypes
    restful?: RestfulOptionsTypes
    jsonDark?: ReactJsonViewThemeKey
    jsonLight?: ReactJsonViewThemeKey
}
```

Under the covers, this addon uses Axios for Restful queries and Apollo Client for GraphQL queries. These configs are optional, though you'll likely want to use one or both. The configs will also be merged with the optional configs being passed through the parameters.

#### [Parameters](https://storybook-addon-headless.netlify.com/?path=/story/parameters--page)

Parameters are added locally via:

-   `storiesOf('Name', module).addParameters({ headless: { ... } })`
-   `add(name, storyFn, { headless: { ... } })`
-   Via CSF:

```js
export default {
    ...,
    parameters: {
        headless: { ... }
    },
    ...,
}
```

You can find parameters document as [HeadlessParameters](https://github.com/ArrayKnight/storybook-addon-headless/blob/master/src/types/parameters.ts) and on the [documentation site](https://storybook-addon-headless.netlify.com/?path=/story/parameters--page).

```js
{
    headless: {
        [name]: HeadlessParameter,
        ...,
    }
}
```

`name` is the string to represent the query and data. It will be shown in the tab for the query and be the accessor on the data object in the story context.

`HeadlessParameter` represents several different possible options:

-   `string`: Restful URL
-   `PackedDocumentNode`: A `pack`ed GraphQL Tag `DocumentNode`
-   `GraphQLParameters`: [An object](https://github.com/ArrayKnight/storybook-addon-headless/blob/master/src/types/parameters.ts) with a `PackedDocumentNode` as a query and some optional parameters
-   `RestfulParameters`: [An object](https://github.com/ArrayKnight/storybook-addon-headless/blob/master/src/types/parameters.ts) with a Restful URL string as a query and some optional parameters

Due to an [issue within Storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/9534) where data is stringified with a maxDepth, there is data loss on ordinary GraphQL Tag `DocumentNode`s. To bypass this issue until it can be resolved, this addon exports a `pack` function which preemptively flattens the `DocumentNode` to avoid data loss.

### Produced @ [GenUI](https://www.genui.com/)
